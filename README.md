# Sleep_Prediction
Sleep Prediction with Machine Learning
This repository contains a machine learning project that builds a predictive model for sleep-related metrics. The goal of this project is to explore and implement a machine learning workflow, from initial data exploration and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

Project Contents
The core of this repository is the Sleep_Prediction.ipynb Jupyter Notebook, which includes the following sections:

Data Loading & Exploration: Initial analysis of the dataset to understand its structure and key characteristics.

Data Preprocessing: Steps taken to clean the data and prepare it for modeling, including handling missing values and scaling features.

Model Training: Training of multiple machine learning models to find the best fit for the prediction task.

Model Evaluation: A comprehensive evaluation of the models' performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to determine the most effective one.

Final Results: The final output, summarizing the performance of the best model and its key hyperparameters.

Technologies Used
This project was built using the following libraries and tools:

Python

Jupyter Notebook: For creating and sharing the code and results.

scikit-learn: For machine learning model implementation and evaluation.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: For numerical operations.

Matplotlib / Seaborn: For data visualization.
